PERFORMANCE COMPARISON RESULTS - 3/25/2025 2:23:27 AM
=======================================
EF Core execution time: 1052.42 ms
Dapper execution time: 188.49 ms
Performance difference: 5.58x

Performance Analysis:
1. Dapper is typically faster because it's a lightweight micro-ORM with minimal overhead
2. EF Core provides more features but at the cost of performance
3. The difference becomes more pronounced with larger datasets

When to use each:
- Use EF Core for: Complex domain models, frequent updates, when productivity is more important than raw speed
- Use Dapper for: Read-heavy workloads, performance-critical operations, large dataset retrieval
